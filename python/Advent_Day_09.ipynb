    "# --- Day 9: Stream Processing ---\n",
    "\n",
    "> A large stream blocks your path. According to the locals, it's not safe to cross the stream at the moment because it's full of garbage. You look down at the stream; rather than water, you discover that it's a stream of characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "> You sit for a while and record part of the stream (your puzzle input). The characters represent groups - sequences that begin with { and end with }. Within a group, there are zero or more other things, separated by commas: either another group or garbage. Since groups can contain other groups, a } only closes the most-recently-opened unclosed group - that is, they are nestable. Your puzzle input represents a single, large group which itself contains many smaller ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Sometimes, instead of a group, you will find garbage. Garbage begins with < and ends with >. Between those angle brackets, almost any character can appear, including { and }. Within garbage, < has no special meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In a futile attempt to clean up the garbage, some program has canceled some of the characters within it using !: inside garbage, any character that comes after ! should be ignored, including <, >, and even another !.\n",
    "\n",
    "> You don't see any characters that deviate from these rules. Outside garbage, you only find well-formed groups, and garbage always terminates according to the rules above.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Here are some self-contained pieces of garbage:\n",
    "\n",
    "    <>, empty garbage.\n",
    "    <random characters>, garbage containing random characters.\n",
    "    <<<<>, because the extra < are ignored.\n",
    "    <{!>}>, because the first > is canceled.\n",
    "    <!!>, because the second ! is canceled, allowing the > to terminate the garbage.\n",
    "    <!!!>>, because the second ! and the first > are canceled.\n",
    "    <{o\"i!a,<{i<a>, which ends at the first >.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Here are some examples of whole streams and the number of groups they contain:\n",
    "\n",
    "    {}, 1 group.\n",
    "    {{{}}}, 3 groups.\n",
    "    {{},{}}, also 3 groups.\n",
    "    {{{},{},{{}}}}, 6 groups.\n",
    "    {<{},{},{{}}>}, 1 group (which itself contains garbage).\n",
    "    {<a>,<a>,<a>,<a>}, 1 group.\n",
    "    {{<a>},{<a>},{<a>},{<a>}}, 5 groups.\n",
    "    {{<!>},{<!>},{<!>},{<a>}}, 2 groups (since all but the last > are canceled).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Your goal is to find the total score for all groups in your input. Each group is assigned a score which is one more than the score of the group that immediately contains it. (The outermost group gets a score of 1.)\n",
    "\n",
    "    {}, score of 1.\n",
    "    {{{}}}, score of 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.\n",
    "    {{},{}}, score of 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.\n",
    "    {{{},{},{{}}}}, score of 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 16.\n",
    "    {<a>,<a>,<a>,<a>}, score of 1.\n",
    "    {{<ab>},{<ab>},{<ab>},{<ab>}}, score of 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 9.\n",
